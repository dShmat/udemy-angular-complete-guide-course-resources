# Personal Code Folder

This folder contains resources (code snapshots, extra files etc.) for completing homework and check
examples from [Angular - The Complete Guide](https://acad.link/angular) online course.

## How To Use

All code inside is my personal attempts to complete examples tasks from the course. It can be used in the future
to refresh my knowledge of topics. 

## Using Code Snapshots

Code snapshots are complete Angular projects.

## Running the Code

As mentioned, the code snapshots provided in this repository are complete Angular projects.

But once you downloaded them you can also run the code snapshots on your machine. To do this, you must perform the following steps:

### 1) Install dependencies

First, you must re-create the `node_modules` folder and install all required third-party dependencies.

This is done via the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

**Important:** You must be navigated into the project folder (inside your terminal / command prompt) before running this command.

### 2) Run the development server

As a next step, you can start the development server via

```shell
npm start
```

or 

```shell
ng serve
```
